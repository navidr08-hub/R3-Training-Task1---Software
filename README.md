# Project Overview: # 
This project involves designing an arduino circuit to operate two motors, synchronously. 
These motors act as the wheels of a robot. This is done by using a L293D motor controller while using a potentiometer to control the speed, with PWM pins. 
A dip switch was then used to choose the control modes, to decide how the motors operate, or how the robot moves (forward, backward, right, left).
